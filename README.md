# DynamicCryptoCoreSolutions2

## Description

A repository containing a novel zero-knowledge proof system implemented in Rust, leveraging zk-SNARKs with custom elliptic curves for enhanced performance in privacy-preserving cryptocurrency transactions.

## Features

- Integrate hardware security modules (HSMs) for secure key storage and management.
- Implement zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable privacy-preserving data sharing.
- Utilize federated learning algorithms to train machine learning models on decentralized data.
- Develop a RESTful API for seamless integration with existing cryptocurrency exchanges.
- Deploy a distributed ledger technology (DLT) based solution for supply chain tracking.
- Employ homomorphic encryption to perform computations on encrypted data without decryption.
- Design a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions and data access.
- Implement automated vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to ensure security.
